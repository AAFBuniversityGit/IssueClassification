# IssueClassification

This repository focuses on the classification of GitHub issues using artificial intelligence, specifically leveraging the power of ML.NET. The goal is to automate the process of categorizing and labeling issues in GitHub repositories, making project management more efficient and streamlined.

## Key Features
- **ML.NET Integration**: Utilize the ML.NET framework to build, train, and deploy machine learning models for classifying GitHub issues.
- **Issue Categorization**: Automatically classify issues into predefined categories such as bug reports, feature requests, documentation, and more.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes scripts and tools for preprocessing issue data, such as text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
- **Model Training**: Train models using historical issue data from GitHub repositories, with options to fine-tune and evaluate model performance.
- **Prediction and Automation**: Implement a prediction pipeline to automatically label new issues as they are created, reducing manual effort.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend the classification categories or adapt the model to suit specific repository needs.

This repository serves as a practical example of applying machine learning to real-world software development tasks, using a .NET-based ecosystem. Whether you're a developer looking to improve your GitHub workflows or someone interested in machine learning applications, this project offers a hands-on approach to issue classification.
